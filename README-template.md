## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Javascript Methods - String Methods, Date Methods, Number Methods

### What I learned

Learnt more about how css grid can be very useful in a site layout and how it can be used more properly. It is still a complicating code area for me cos' it basically has it's PROs and CONs and can totally deform a site if not used properly.

### Continued development

- Grid Overlapping
- Form Validations

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Overlapping](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid overlapping. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Regex Formats](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for knowing the patterns for specific input values. By learning this you get to define what patterns you want your input fields to be; Very useful when making forms.
